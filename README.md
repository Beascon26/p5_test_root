I have learned that repos are buckets of code and projects. You can pull the bucket of code off to the side to work on it and that is called a pull. It is very literal it means that it is pulled off to the side so you can work on it. 
When you are done you can send it back to the original timeline. This is called a push, you are pushing the code back to the regular time line. 
When it goes back to the normal time line it rejoins with the code and combines the working code from the pull that the other person made, and the original working code from before the pull.
